# Github-Scraping
My try to scrap users data using Github API 

# Version 1:
It will scrap users data 
- Users from Pakistan
- has repos greater than 50
- name user name email 

Data will be in json file (total enteries 1200)


# Version 2:
It also scraping the users programming languages used in his repos. But I have narrowed down searching criteria to (has repos greater than 600)

Actualy programming languages can`t be accessed directly from user`s information using Github API. So I have made my logic to get the programming languages used by the user in his repos.
It will iterate all over the repos of the user and get the unique programming languages it is using. 

(Total enteries to json file 4)
